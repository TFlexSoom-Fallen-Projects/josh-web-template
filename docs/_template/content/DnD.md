# Roleplaying and Tabletops #
My friends and I really enjoy playing Tabletop Role Playing Games. This includes the famous [Dungeons and Dragons](https://dnd.wizards.com/). It has helped the group connect and hang out periodically without wasting money. I have a blast when I play. We've had a wide variety of players transition through the group, but there is always room at the table. I hope to continue playing with my friends throughout our lives.

## Custom Classes ##
I have created my own classes before. This includes a shapeshifting knight. We use them if the Dungeon Master allows, but many of our players don't strictly follow the rulebooks. 

## My typical Day ##
```javascript
if(sunny){
    go_to_park();
}else{
    stay_inside();
    read();
    invent();
    play_guild_wars(); 
}
```
