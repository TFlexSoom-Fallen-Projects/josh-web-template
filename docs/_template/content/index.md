# All about Josh Kaler #
*Hey everyone*, this is a site all about me, Josh Kaler. I created this website with help from a friend. I am an up and coming theature and physics enthusiast. I really enjoyed my performance in the show _Camelot_. Feel free to ask me about it! You'll probably recognize me from my sick ride or killer shades. Most individuals mention my wicked hair. I really enjoy playing DnD. I may post some of our character class ideas. I really enjoy playing Rogue. I had a tendency to steal from my teammates, but despite ethics it allowed me to solely survive the recent campaign. But yeah, that's a bit about me.

## Why a website? ##
I wanted to show off my abilities in a creative way. This website provides proof of life. I also hope to move on to University in the future. This may help in consideration of my abilities.

## Why Physics ##
*I Just Find It Genuinely Interesting* You know?

## Why British Comedy ##
I think if you need to count to 5...
