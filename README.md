# Standard Website for Self-Marketting and Otherwise
After doing some web development work, I wanted to see how cool of a site I could make on my own. The goal of this project is to create a standardized website for any purpose. This is more than just having a bootstrap template, using class names to create sufficient styles. This should also include ways to change the content as well. Adding images and responsiveness, the site should handle ample information.

This will be a static site rather than a dynamic. Everything should be servable via Browserside javascript. I will also include a grunt build process as the best services come in simple node packages.

# How to Run the Site
Go to index.html within the example directory. The browser should take care of the rest.

## Creating your own site
Go to the tools directory and view the documentation directory there.
