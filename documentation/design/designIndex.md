# Philosophy
There will be a multitude of React tags which will be used in tags.jsx

One of these will include the `<MarkedDown>` tag which will encapsulate markdown sections. There will also be other very usable tags. This will be a one stop shop for a quick documenation or website built from scratch.

## Done
- ReactJS for `<MarkedDown>`

## TODO
- ReactJS for `<Slides>`
- RactsJS for `<Nav-Header>`
- Marked Down hooked up correctly
- CSS modules for the project

## Considerations
- Maybe use Sass?
- Other uses for Grunt
