# Philosophy
The template represents the generation starting point. Every developer can use and edit the template. Running grunt will solidify the jsx modules.
They will provide the browseable site for simple usage. The content directory which is also in the template will provide all *Markdown* content
and JSON settings. These will remain editable even upon serving the site. The template can be recreated and repurposed.
